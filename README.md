This repo exists to allow me room To play with Clojure and become more adept at using emacs.

Programming and mathematics have intrigued me for years, but alas, I have to work very hard at both to make even modest progress.

### Where to Start
Now that I stumbled my way through remembering how to use Git, it's on to the world of learning how to use emacs. My goal is to be using emacs as a Clojure IDE by Easter Sunday, so from now until then I envision many little commits containing Clojure learning exercises.
