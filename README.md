This repo exists to allow me room to play with Clojure and become more adept at using emacs.

Programming and mathematics have intrigued me for years, but alas, I have to work very hard at both to make even modest progress. But work I will, and maybe someday I'll be a real programmer.

### Where to Start
The tutorial at braveclojure.com is great, and because of it I already have emacs comfortably configured with the Cider REPL for Clojure. I see the first steps going like this:

+ Become an honest emacs user by using it  whenever you work with text.
+ Dabble in Clojure here and there from now until the end of the semester.  There won't be lots of time for this, so I won't feel bad that I can only dabble.
+ Try a bit harder to find useful Clojure learning opportunities over the summer.

### Interested in Functional Programming and/or Clojure?
Watch [this video](https://vimeo.com/68375202) if you're interested in learning about Clojure and functional programming. 

### Final Thought
Ultimately I aspire to be a solid programmer, but I also know I don't have the intellectual capital that many other programmers have. What I *do* have is an everlasting curiosity about solving problems with software and mathematics combined with a track record of persistent lifelong learning habits. I'll get there someday.
